#Psyringe's Password Generator<br>
###What's this?<br>
It's an application for Linux, Windows and OS X, that generates strong passwords for you.<br>
Currently untested on Windows and OS X. <br>
It's built on Shoes3 for Ruby, with no other gems used.<br>
###How does it work?<br>
1. Open the app, in the "Alias" field, type in the subject of the password (e.g. "google.com")<br>
2. Type in a secret, which acts as a key. It's easier to use one secret for all of your passwords, though be careful about your secret, because once somebody could know your secret, he can crack all your passwords.<br>
3. Click on the "Generate" button.<br>
4. The program generates a password for you in the "Password" field. Copy that and use it.<br>
###What good is this?<br>
You can generate very strong passwords. All you have to do is to remember your secret for ever.<br>
###Are you a professional Ruby/Shoes3 programmer?<br>
<b>NO!</b> I'm not a pro Ruby expert. This is my first Shoes3 app, so it has lots of issues.<br>
###I can fix your code or contribute to it. Is this possible?<br>
Of course! Feel free to open issues or make pull requests. As said, I'm not pro, so my coding is kinda bad in Ruby. Help me if you can.<br>
###License?<br>
It's not a big deal for such an small code, but it's released under BSD 3-clause license.<br>
